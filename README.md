## About this Repository
This repository contains my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms problems as part of my coursework. Each problem is carefully solved, documented, and tested to ensure correctness and efficiency.

## What I Did
- Solved multiple problems covering key topics such as arrays, linked lists, trees, sorting, and recursion.
- Implemented all solutions in C++ with detailed comments explaining the logic and approach.
- Captured screenshots of successful submissions to verify correctness.
- Organized each problem into separate folders with problem links, code, explanations, and submission proof.

## What I Learned
- Enhanced my understanding of fundamental data structures and their traversal techniques.
- Practiced implementing efficient algorithms like in-place array merging and recursive tree traversal.
- Improved my ability to write clean, well-commented, and maintainable code.
- Developed problem-solving skills, including breaking down problems and handling edge cases effectively.

## Challenges Faced
- Managing recursive calls and ensuring base cases were correctly handled.
- Writing in-place algorithms without using extra memory.
- Optimizing solutions to meet time constraints while maintaining readability.
- Translating problem statements into efficient code under strict guidelines.
