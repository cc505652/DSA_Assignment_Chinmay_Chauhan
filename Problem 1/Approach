The approach uses a two-pointer technique to merge two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 in-place.
We start by comparing the largest elements of both arrays from the end and place the larger element at the end of nums1. 
This continues until all elements from nums2 are merged, with any remaining elements from nums1 already in their correct positions.
